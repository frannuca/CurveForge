# TiledCurve Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the TiledCurve feature for the CurveForge project, which enables bond and swap pricers to use instantaneous forward rates calibrated by the optimization library.

## Problem Statement

The original requirement was to:
> Update the bond and swap pricers in the CurveForge project to accept a tiled curve for discounting. This tiled curve should internally use the instantaneous forward rates calibrated in the optimization library. Ensure the changes are modular and do not disrupt the existing functionality of the pricers. Include unit tests to validate the new functionality.

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Core Components

#### TiledCurve Class
**Location**: `libs/pricing/include/pricing/curve/tiled_curve.hpp` and `libs/pricing/src/tiled_curve.cpp`

A new class that represents a yield curve parameterized by instantaneous forward rates at pillar points.

**Key Features**:
- Stores instantaneous forward rates at calibration pillars
- Linearly interpolates forward rates between pillars
- Computes discount factors by integrating forward rates using trapezoidal rule
- Provides forward rate queries for any time point

**Public API**:
```cpp
class TiledCurve {
public:
    TiledCurve(const std::vector<double>& pillar_times, 
               const std::vector<double>& forwards);
    
    double discount(double t) const;
    double instantaneous_forward(double t) const;
    double get_forward(double t, double dT) const;
    
    const std::vector<double>& pillarTimes() const;
    const std::vector<double>& forwardRates() const;
};
```

#### Mathematical Implementation

**Forward Rate Interpolation**:
```
f(t) = f(tᵢ) + (t - tᵢ)/(tᵢ₊₁ - tᵢ) × (f(tᵢ₊₁) - f(tᵢ))
```

**Discount Factor Computation**:
```
D(t) = exp(-∫₀ᵗ f(s) ds)
```

where the integral is computed using trapezoidal rule:
```
∫₀ᵗ f(s) ds ≈ Σᵢ 0.5 × (f(tᵢ₋₁) + f(tᵢ)) × (tᵢ - tᵢ₋₁)
```

This is **exactly the same** approach used by the optimizer in `optimizer.cpp`, ensuring numerical consistency.

### 2. Integration with Existing Components

#### Bond Pricer Enhancement
**Location**: `libs/pricing/include/pricing/bond/bond.hpp` and `libs/pricing/src/bond/bond.cpp`

Added a new method to the `Bond` class:
```cpp
double priceFromCurve(const std::function<double(double)>& discount_fn) const;
```

This method:
- Accepts any discount function (including TiledCurve)
- Prices bonds by discounting all cash flows
- Maintains backward compatibility (existing methods unchanged)

**Implementation**:
```cpp
double Bond::priceFromCurve(const std::function<double(double)>& discount_fn) const {
    double price = 0.0;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < coupon_times_.size(); ++i) {
        double t = coupon_times_[i];
        double cf = coupon_amounts_[i];
        double df = discount_fn(t);
        price += cf * df;
    }
    return price;
}
```

#### Swap Pricer (No Changes Required)
**Location**: `libs/pricing/src/irswap.cpp`

The `IRSwap` class already accepts discount functions via `solveDiscount()`, so it works seamlessly with TiledCurve without any modifications. This demonstrates the modularity of the design.

#### Optimizer Integration
**Location**: `libs/pricing/include/pricing/curve/optimizer.hpp` and `libs/pricing/src/optimizer.cpp`

Enhanced `CalibrationResult` to include:
```cpp
struct CalibrationResult {
    YieldCurve curve;                  // Original representation
    std::vector<double> pillar_times;  // NEW: Pillar times
    std::vector<double> forward_rates; // NEW: Calibrated forwards
    // ... other fields
};
```

Modified `CurveOptimizer::calibrate()` to populate these fields:
```cpp
result.pillar_times = pillar_times_;
result.forward_rates = forwards;
```

This allows direct construction of TiledCurve from calibration results.

### 3. Testing
