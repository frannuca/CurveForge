# Implied Forward Rate Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds the capability to compute **implied forward rates** from bond futures pricing to the CurveForge library. This is a critical metric for fixed income analysis, yield curve construction, and derivatives pricing.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Functionality
- **New Method**: `BondFuture::impliedForwardRate()`
  - Location: `libs/pricing/src/bond/bond_future.cpp`
  - Header: `libs/pricing/include/pricing/bond/bond_future.hpp`
  - Calculates the forward interest rate implied by bond futures pricing
  - Uses continuous compounding for consistency with derivatives pricing
  - Handles both contango and backwardation market conditions

### 2. Mathematical Formula

```
Implied Forward Rate = (1/T) × ln((Futures Price × Conversion Factor) / Bond Price)
```

Where:
- `T` = Time to futures maturity (years)
- `Conversion Factor` = Normalizes bonds with different characteristics
- `Bond Price` = Current market price (clean price)
- `Futures Price` = Current futures contract price

### 3. Input Validation and Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:
- ✓ Out-of-range bond index validation
- ✓ Non-positive price validation
- ✓ Zero maturity validation
- ✓ Appropriate exception types with descriptive messages

### 4. Testing

Comprehensive test suite added to `tests/pricing/test_bond_pricing.cpp`:
- ✓ Basic calculation verification
- ✓ Contango market conditions
- ✓ Backwardation market conditions
- ✓ Multiple bond scenarios
- ✓ Error handling (invalid indices, negative prices, zero prices)
- ✓ Consistency with implied repo rate for CTD bonds
- ✓ All tests pass successfully

### 5. Documentation

#### User Documentation
- **Main Documentation**: `docs/IMPLIED_FORWARD_RATE.md`
  - Mathematical background and formulas
  - Complete API reference
  - Usage examples (4 detailed examples)
  - Practical applications
  - Integration with existing metrics
  - Technical notes on precision and edge cases
  - References to academic literature

#### Code Documentation
- Updated class-level documentation in header file
- Comprehensive inline documentation with mathematical explanations
- Exception specifications in docstrings

### 6. Examples

Enhanced `examples/bond_pricing_examples.cpp` with:
- Demonstration of implied forward rate calculation
- Comparison across multiple bonds
- Explanation of relationship with repo rate
- Real-world market scenarios

## Key Features

### Modular Design
- ✓ Follows existing code patterns and conventions
- ✓ Minimal changes to existing code (only additions)
- ✓ Consistent with `impliedRepoRate()` design
- ✓ No breaking changes to existing API

### Robustness
- ✓ Handles negative forward rates (backwardation)
- ✓ Validates all inputs before calculation
- ✓ Uses appropriate exception types
- ✓ Thread-safe (const method)
- ✓ No side effects

### Integration
- ✓ Complements existing bond futures metrics
- ✓ Works seamlessly with CTD analysis
- ✓ Compatible with futures pricing calculations
- ✓ Integrates with example suite

## Usage Example

```cpp
#include "pricing/bond.hpp"

using namespace pricing::bond;

// Create a bond futures contract
Bond bond(100.0, 0.06, 10.0, 2);
std::vector<Bond> bonds = {bond};
std::vector<double> cfs = {1.0};
BondFuture future(0.5, bonds, cfs);

// Calculate implied forward rate
double bond_price = 105.0;
double futures_price = 106.5;
double forward_rate = future.impliedForwardRate(0, bond_price, futures_price);

std::cout << "Implied forward rate: " << (forward_rate * 100) << "%" << std::endl;
```

## Testing Results

All tests pass:
```
Testing implied forward rate calculations...
  Test 1 - Forward rate (contango): -0.08922303
  Test 2 - Forward rate (positive carry): 0.096857032
  Test 3 - Forward rate (bond 2): 0.057614165
  ✓ Caught expected out_of_range exception
  ✓ Caught expected invalid_argument exception for negative price
  ✓ Caught expected invalid_argument exception for zero price
  Test 7 - Forward rate (backwardation): -0.48955686
✓ Implied forward rate tests passed
```
